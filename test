Create an algorithm in Java or JS that creates and prints out 150 persons. 
Each person should be randomly given a name and an integer ID (from 1 to 150). 
Name should be randomly composed of given name and surname. Please use these lists:

Name        Surname
-----       ---------
Harry       Lovelace
Ada         Doe
Elon        Potter
Jane        Musk

For ID divisible by 3 the algorithm should print out "Eligible for loan". 
For ID divisible by 5 it should print out "Loan pending". 
For ID divisible by both 5 and 3 it should print out "Loan already provided".
For all other IDs it should print out "no data".

Output structure on each row should be following:
$ID$ - $GIVEN_NAME$ $SURNAME$ - $PRINTOUT_STATEMENT

example:
...
20 - Harry Lovelace - Loan pending
21 - Jane Musk - Eligible for loan 
22 - Ada Doe - no data
...
